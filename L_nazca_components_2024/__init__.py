Initialization of L_nazca_components_2024.

Uses Nazca (https://nazca-design.org/) to create functions for common photonics components. Functions that end with '_' can be used, but might not always be needed. Almost all 'make' functions have a more user-friendly counterpart in the 'User-Friendly Functions' section.
