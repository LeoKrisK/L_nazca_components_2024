"""
Initialization of NxN_circuit: NxN unitary matrix photonic circuit.

Used to create a circuit given an NxN unitary matrix.
The vast majority of these functions can be used for all encodings, but they are best suited for path encoding. Contains the functions necessary to create a circuit with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer design, consisting of phase shifters and 50/50 beam splitters in the shape mentioned in Reck et al.'s "Optimal design for universal multiport interferometers".
